- memoization isn't the most convenient thing
- I still need a custom parser for any lookahead that I want (since I don't have it built in) (see multiline comments)
- when I memoized, I didn't want to return the memoized value, since it was wrapped so that I could adapt for all four kinds of nodes
- parser is easy to write by pasting grammar in a comment, then letting AI autocomplete. It took maybe 2 hours
- hard to debug infinite loop caused by parsing
- 'many' must consume something
  - cannot have a nested 'many': `many (many (char '0'))`
- need to have a single cached value that I convert to and from
- an "error handler" just consumes the rest of the string, then returns an `Error`
  - however, requires ordered choice
